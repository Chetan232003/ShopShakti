🛠️ Tech Stack (Frontend)
Angular 19 with standalone component architecture
TypeScript
Angular Router for route management and guards
Material Icons, FontAwesome for UI elements
🔒 Admin Access
Admin routes are protected using an AuthService and canActivateAdmin guard. Only users with role admin can access the dashboard.

if (auth.isLoggedIn() && auth.isAdmin()) {
  return true;
}
📦 Run Frontend Locally
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run dev server
ng serve
Access the app at: http://localhost:4200

🔧 Backend Overview (ASP.NET Core)
The backend is a RESTful API built with ASP.NET Core Web API, using Entity Framework Core for data persistence and SQL Server as the database.

🔐 Security Architecture
ShopShakti is designed with a strong focus on secure authentication, data protection, and access control. Below are the key security features implemented:

✅ Authentication & Authorization
JWT-based Authentication
Secure login with JSON Web Tokens (JWT), including issuer, audience, and HMAC SHA256 signing.
Token Expiration & Validation
Tokens expire based on a configurable time (ExpiresInMinutes), enforced using ValidateLifetime and ClockSkew = 0.
Role-Based Access Control
Admin and user routes are guarded using Angular route guards (canActivateAdmin, canActivateUser).
Password Hashing
User passwords are securely hashed using ASP.NET Core’s PasswordHasher<T> before being saved to the database.
✅ API & Backend Security
[Authorize] Decorators
Sensitive API endpoints (e.g. profile, orders, cart) are protected using [Authorize], while public routes like registration and login use [AllowAnonymous].
CORS Policy Enforcement
Backend is configured to allow only trusted frontend origins (e.g., http://localhost:4200).
Blocked User Handling
Blocked users are denied access during login and receive a 403 Forbidden response.
✅ Frontend Safeguards
JWT Interceptor
Angular HTTP interceptor automatically attaches Authorization: Bearer <token> to every protected API request.
Secure Token Storage
JWT and user info (excluding password) are stored safely in localStorage. Passwords are never exposed to the client.
Route Guards
Angular guards restrict access to protected routes like /profile, /cart, /checkout, and /admin.
✅ All critical flows (login, logout, registration, token validation, admin access, and blocked user control) have been implemented securely and verified.
This setup follows modern best practices for Angular + ASP.NET Core Web API + SQL Server applications.

✅ Future Enhancements
Wishlist & Payment gateway

Advanced search, filters, and pagination

Product ratings and reviews

Order tracking & invoice downloads
